		Represents a successful purchase transaction.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This class contains details about a purchase, such as the product ID, purchase date, and expiration date (for subscriptions).

		When you receive a transaction update, you must call the [method finish] method on the transaction once you have made sure 
		that you have delivered the content to the user.

		<method name="finish">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				The finish method notifies the App Store that the app has successfully provided the purchased content or 
				activated the purchased service, allowing the transaction to be completed.

				Call [method finish] only after your app has delivered the content or enabled the service. If the purchase 
				includes on-demand resources, wait to finish the transaction until the download is complete or the 
				resources have otherwise been fully delivered.
